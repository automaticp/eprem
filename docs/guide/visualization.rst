Goats
----------

Goats is a set of tools for analyzing heliophysical datasets, but, in
particular, can be used to visualise the output from EPREM runs and,
optionally, compare that output with observations of energetic particles.

Goats can be installed using the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install goats

Detailed instructions for using it with EPREM can be found at:
